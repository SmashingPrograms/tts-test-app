# TTS Test App

Quick React + FastAPI app to test text-to-speech technology.

Uses espeak-ng for open-source TTS.

# Potential future

I'll test out Kokoro in the future. Kokoro is also open-source and uses a more complex machine-learning text-to-speech method, but the downside is there's a lot of installation and dependencies attached to it.
